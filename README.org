#+TITLE: Chance of an event in a dice game

* Overview

  This is a learning projectfur rust.  The goal was to calculate the
  chance of throwing a six and a five then throwing doubles.

  There are easier ways to achieve this but I wanted to try a
  moderately complex app in rust.

  I coded this entirely on my phone after a week of learning rust.  So
  I'm sure it is full of issues.  I want to leave it as is but any
  form of critique is welcome via issues.

* Building and running

  Issueing =cargo run= will build and run the project.
